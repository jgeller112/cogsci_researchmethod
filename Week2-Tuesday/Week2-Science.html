# Truth or Fiction?

- Most people use only about 10% of their brain capacity

- Student's learn best when teaching styles match their learning styles (e.g., visual, auditory, etc.)

- In general, it’s better to express anger that to hold it in

- The lie detector (polygraph) test is 90-95 % accurate at detecting falsehoods

- Standing in a power pose with your hands on your hips and your feet apart makes you more confident

---

# Truth or Fiction?

- People tend to be romantically attracted to individuals who are opposite to them in personality and attitude

- The more people present at an emergency, the more likely it is that at least one of them will help

- All effective psychotherapies require clients to get the root of their problems in childhood

- Napping just after learning new information will help you remember it better

- Studying material many times in short chunks (“spaced practice”) will lead to better test performance than cramming in one session just before the test

Question: Is there a difference in how we acquired one type of knowledge from the other?

---
class: inverse center middle

# How do we know what we know?

---
# Types of Knowledge

- Intuition/Anecdote
--

  - Acquire knowledge without proof, evidence, or conscious reasoning, or without understanding how the knowledge was acquired 
--

- Authority

--
  - Aristotle once said, "Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible."
  - We acquire knowledge through authority (e.g., parents)
--

- Rationalism

--
  - We acquire knowledge through logic and reason
    - All people are mortal. You are a person. Conclusion: You are mortal.
--

- Empiricism

--
  - We acquire knowledge through experience and observation
---

# The Scientific Method

&lt;img src="ScienceUpdate.png" width="36%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
---
# Finding Inspiration

- Observations

- Practical problem

- Previous research

--

&lt;img src="sf.jpeg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

Examples: 

practical problems: how certain drugs affect disorders?

# Hypothesis

&gt; A specific prediction about a phenomeonon

- Should be driven by past studies in that area

  - Can be exploratory! 

- Must be testable and falsifiable

- Positive

   - Can also be negative! 

  &gt; Hypothesis 1: Reading materials in Sans Forgetica typeface enhances memory
  
  &gt; Hypothesis 2: Reading materials in Sans Forgetica does not enhance memory
  

---

# Test Hypothesis

- Have 30 participants study word pairs in Sans Forgetica and Arial (**independent variable**) 

- Measure performance on final test (**dependent variable**)

---

# Name That Variable!


&gt; An organizational psychologist is interested in whether lowering the temperature in a factory will increase productivity (i.e., number of products assembled). At the factory, there are three rooms in which products are assembled. Each room is set at one of the following temperatures: 60 degrees, 70 degrees, or 80 degrees. 

&gt; A psychologist is studying the effects of steroids on the aggressive behavior of male rats. Thirty rats receive twice-daily injections of a placebo, whereas another set of 30 rats receive twice-daily injections of a steroid. For one hour a day, the rats are placed in a cage together and all aggressive behaviors are recorded. For one week, lab assistants count the number of aggressive behaviors recorded to determine whether or not there is difference between the two groups of rats. 

???

One independent variable – temperature in the room
	Three levels/conditions (60, 70, vs. 80 degrees)
Dependent variable – productivity (number of products assembled)

One independent variable – substance in injections
	Two levels/conditions (placebo vs. steroid)
Dependent variable –frequency aggressive behaviors

---
# Analyze Data and Draw Conclusions

- No difference between Sans Forgetica and Arial typefaces

  - Is this meaningful or **statistically significant**?

    - Inferential Statistics 
  
     - Allows one to draw conclusions from our **sample** (small subset) to **population** (large group we are interested in) 
    
     - Bayesian Statistics

# Replicate Findings

&lt;img src="rep.jpeg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# Features of Science

- Systematic empiricism
  - Design controlled studies to observe behavior and draw conclusions
--

- Publicly verifiable knowledge
 - Present research so it can be observed, replicated, criticized, and tested in other ways
--

- Empirically solvable
  - Questions can be answered
  - Falsifiability
---

# Think - Pair - Share 


- List three empirical questions about human behavior. List three non-empirical questions about human behavior

---

# Scientific Norms

- Mertonian Norms (1942)

1. Universalism
    - Knowledge is knowledge regardless who comes up with it
    
2. Disinterestedness
    - Our goal as scientists is to make advancements--not cash in
  
3. Communality

    - Openly share knowledge - remove the paywall
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY
  
4. Organized Skepticism
    - Accept nothing at face value!

# Goals of Science

1. Describe 

2. Predict 

3. Explain

#  What Is Cognitive Science? 

- “The interdisciplinary study of mind and intelligence” 
- “Study of cognitive processes involved in the acquisition, representation, and use of human knowledge” 
- “Scientific study of the mind, the brain, and intelligent behavior, whether in humans, animals, machines or the abstract”

**Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary (scientific) study of the mind as an information processor**

  + Goal of Cognitive Science: to understand the mind and how it works.
---

# Cognitive

**Cognitive** Science is the interdisciplinary (scientific) study of the mind as an information processor

- Cognition – from Latin base cognitio – “know together”

- The collection of mental processes and activities used in perceiving, learning, remembering, thinking, and understanding and the act of using those processes

---
# What is a mind?

+ Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary  (scientific) study of the **mind** as an information processor

  - What would an answer to this question look like?

--
+ Is it identical to the physical matter of the brain?

+ Is it the organization or structure of physical matter?
	
+ Is it equivalent to the operations the brain performs?
	
+ Is it completely outside or beyond the physical brain?

---

#  Mind 

+ Do animals have minds?
	
+ Do computers have minds?
	
+ Does mind mean consciousness?
	
+ Can a mind be distributed?

  + Working definition : a mind is a set of mental processes and cognitive capacities.
