# Final Project

I have designed the course to involve a replication study within your area of interest. The replication studies should take some preexisting manipulation and aim to replicate it on a smaller, more manageable scale. There are three primary pedagogical reasons for structuring the final projects in this way:


 1. Replications provide an entry point into research: It is difficult to develop an original
research idea, especially when you’re just starting to learn about an area. The problem is
only exacerbated by the expansiveness of cognitive science. So, the idea is that by trying
to delve into an area where the basic questions have been mapped out already will help
ease you into doing the actual research.
 2. Replications are practical exercises: The replication studies provide a way for us to catch
problems or issues before the final project. I hope that these studies will familiarize you
with some practical elements of basic research.
 3. Replications are part of the scientific process: Much actual research aims to replicate
previous claims, either in whole or in part. Ideally, science consists of replicable results.
Unfortunately, we sometimes find that the results are due to properties of the stimuli, to a
particular subject sample, or to poor experimental design. Thus, replications are integral
to the scientific process, helping us discriminate fact from fiction.

The replication studies are group projects (unless you strongly feel the need to work alone).




1. Form teams: between 2 and 4 people per group (I will form groups based on survey)
2. Complete team charter
3. Find candidates for replication 
4. Meet with me in groups to discuss projects: I’ll make times to meet with each group. 
5. Write a short 1-page research proposal
6. Complete IRB forms
7. Preregister Study: Draft a preregistration of your replication project, using a suitable template provided at the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/zab38/wiki/home/?view. Consult preregistrations for previous studies: https://osf.io/e6auq/wiki/Example%20Preregistrations/?view. Provide feedback to the preregistration of another course participant. Go over the checklist in Aguinis, Hill & Bailey (2021): does the plan contain reasonable choices that are detailed enough? Improve your own preregistration after you have received feedback from one of the other course participants. Register the improved version on the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/registries/osf/new. 
8. Design replication study: try to use similar types of items, but you may need to create your own
9. Program replication study
10. Run replication online (Reddit/SampleSize, Facebook, Twitter, family, friends)
11. Present results to class
12. Write-up project: Focus the report on analytical and methodological decisions and their consequences. Do not include an extensive theory section in the report. The replication report consists of four parts:
    1.	Study Rationale: a brief description of the study that you are attempting to replicate, and reasons why it is important to do so. Draw upon a revised version of assignment 2 for this section. 
    2.	Data and Methods: an elaborate description of the data and the methods you used in the replication. Update the preregistration with the choices you made eventually, and explain the discrepancies (if any) between the pre-registered plans and the execution in practice in an appendix. Include a link to the replication package on the Open Science Framework.
    3.	Results: a clear description of the results of the study, including robustness analyses and extensions (if any). For the assessment it does not matter whether the results of the replication are consistent with the original study or not. 
    4.	Discussion: discuss the limitations of your study. Go over the differences between the data and methods for the original and the replication: at which points did you make different decisions than the original study? Use the checklist here https://osf.io/zwkqj/. Compare the results of the replication with the results of the original study, and try to explain them from differences in the data and methods. What are the implications of the replication with respect to the generalizability of the original findings, and the robustness of the findings with respect to alternative decisions in the research design, data collection, data pre-processing, and analysis? 
Limit the report to 4,000 words. Insert the Tables and Figures in the text.
