# Final Project

I have designed the course to first involve a replication study within your area of interest. The replication studies should take some preexisting manipulation and aim to replicate it on a smaller, more manageable scale. There are three primary pedagogical reasons for structuring the final projects in this way:


 1. Replications provide an entry point into research: It is difficult to develop an original
research idea, especially when you’re just starting to learn about an area. The problem is
only exacerbated by the expansiveness of cognitive science. So, the idea is that by trying
to delve into an area where the basic questions have been mapped out already will help
ease you into doing the actual research.
 2. Replications are practical exercises: The replication studies provide a way for us to catch
problems or issues before the final project. I hope that these studies will familiarize you
with some practical elements of basic research.
 3. Replications are part of the scientific process: Much actual research aims to replicate
previous claims, either in whole or in part. Ideally, science consists of replicable results.
Unfortunately, we sometimes find that the results are due to properties of the stimuli, to a
particular subject sample, or to poor experimental design. Thus, replications are integral
to the scientific process, helping us discriminate fact from fiction.

The replication studies are group projects (unless you strongly feel the need to work alone).

1. Form your groups: between 2 and 4 people per group
2. Decide on a few possible projects
3. Meet with me in groups to discuss projects: I’ll make times to meet with each group. 
4. Write a short 1-page research proposal
5. Write IRB
6. Preregister Study
7. Design replication study: try to use similar types of items, but you may need to create
your own
8. Run replication online
9. Present results to class
