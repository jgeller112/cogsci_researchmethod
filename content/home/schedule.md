I expect students to have read the assigned readings before class. This does not mean just skimming reading, but engaging critically with the scholarship. In particular, look for passages that you disagree with or that seem unclear to you, as these are likely ones that could benefit from further discussion in class. I recommend that, if at all possible, students find a way to mark up the articles or books as they are read to improve reading comprehension.

1Exam considerations were decided at the beginning of April 2020 for the entire academic year. At that time, we thought it was safer not to require a physical final exam venue. Fortunately, we can have class in place, but the exam considerations needed to be moved to online continuous assessment only at that time. We regret any inconvenience.
