# Course Description

The aim for this course is to provide students with the necessary foundation to think critically about research in cognitive science. The course reviews the scientific method and considers the strengths and weaknesses of a range of approaches, such as laboratory experimentation, neuroscience methods, and online data collection. Students will be introduced to statistical reasoning in science, including a basic overview of common statistical techniques. We will also discuss principles for the ethical conduct of research both in the laboratory and online. Students will also get hands-on experience programming and collecting their own data, which will culminate in a paper and presentation. *You can only enroll in this course with a special permission number*. This course counts for 3 credits.

# Learning Goals

1. Be able to evaluate a broad range of methods in cognitive science and consider how they suit various research questions
2. Understand basic principles of experimental design and how to move from a general idea to a specific research question
3. Consider ethical questions and the role of the Institutional Review Board
4. Find appropriate background literature suitable to particular research questions
5. Program your own experiment in Python/PsychoPy and take your research online

# Required Texts

The following book is required. In addition, I will be supplementing the textbook with articles that I will post on Canvas and the course website.

learning management system at Rutgers. You will need a Rutgers NetID to enter Canvas. To
access the course material, go to https://canvas.rutgers.edu/. 

In addition, I have created a website that will host all the materials for this class. 
# Course Policies

## Assignments & Grading

- **20%** (Assignments) You will complete 4 assignments related to the material covered in class and related to your final research project. While this is a group project, all members of a group are expected to turn in a preregistration,IRB, and a programmed experiment. Each assignment below is worth 15 points each. The schedule lists the due dates for each assignment. The assignments are critical to the final project. 

    -  Group Project Proposal: Your group will need submit a short 1-page research proposal. This proposal should summarize the paper you want to replicate and what, if anything, you want to add to the study before you start implementing and collecting data. This is due by 12pm on Sept 27, 2018 (Canvas submission).
      
    - Preregistration. After you have gottten you topic approved, you will pregresiter your experiment (we will dicuss what this is in class). The preregistration should be two primary parts: (1) background and (2) an analysis plan. The background does not need to be lengthy, 2 pages or less, enough information for me to give you feedback on the big idea and feasibility before you get too far along. I will not grade the preregistration for being correct or accurate; I will only grade it for being complete (i.e., if  you answer all the questions but some of your answers are wrong or don’t make sense, you will still get full credit). The preregistration is meant to be an opportunity to get feedback from me early so that you can assess feasibility and develop the idea into a strong final presentation the whole class can benefit from. Structure the background section of your preregistration with the headings below and answer all questions in short paragraphs or bullet form. This does not need to be written like a paper or essay – you can simply paste these questions into a word document and answer them. Once you have settled on your more specific research questions and hypotheses, the next step is to develop a detailed analysis plan. A detailed analysis plan can be used to preregister your study on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io), and makes clear the delineation between confirmatory and exploratory analyses in your final project. For more information about preregistration see: http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/546603-create-a-preregistration.  This analysis plan does not need to be more than a few pages. Importantly, it is an opportunity to get feedback on your plan, before you start analyzing the data. This will help you develop a strong, final demonstration and hopefully a paper you can later pursue for publication. Structure your analysis plan to answer the questions below. Like the background section, you can just answer the questions, you do not need to write an essay.
      
      - Components of the preregistration: 
      
        1.	Broad research question
        2.	Is there a gap in the existing literature that motivates this research question?
        3.	What data source will you use to answer the question?
            a. What are the primary variables of interest and how are they measured?
        4.	Describe the data structure
        5.	What are the specific hypotheses to be tested?
        6.	Does this idea require to you extend beyond the content covered in class?
        7.	Do you foresee any barriers to completing the project?

    - IRB: Although student research projects are covered by the IRB,  the ethicical implications of your research project is important. To this end, you will become CITI certified and also fill out a Rutgers IRB . In order to get full points, you will have to do submit your CITI training certificat (basic behaviroal and social research) and submit IRB. 
     
    - Final programmed experiment: The last several weeks of the course will involve programming your experiment in PsychoPy. Do not worry if you have never used PsychoPy. There will be plenty of time to work on this in class and get help from me and fellow classmates. 
  
- **80%** (Final Project) In this class, you will replicate a published experimental result. Final approval has to come from me. Generally, you should try to pick something you are interested in. The HW assignments are strongly aligned to this project.

    - **40%** (Presentation):  During final exam week you will present your project to the class. This presentation should be 10-15 minutes in length. You should explain your project including, background, hypotheses, methods, results, and conclusions. The goal of these is to practice how to present and discuss empirical evidence in an oral format. For the first presentation, you will present your research proposal to the rest of the class; there will be some time for questions and feedback.
    
    - **40%** (Paper): A research paper is required for this course. The paper will be a write up of the project you presented in class. The paper should follow APA 7th edition guidelines. 

## Absences

Students are expected to attend all classes; if you expect to miss one or two classes, please use the University absence reporting website https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/ to indicate the date and reason for your absence.  An email is automatically sent to me.

# Class Schedule

I expect students to have read the assigned readings before class. This does not mean just skimming reading, but engaging critically with the scholarship. In particular, look for passages that you disagree with or that seem unclear to you, as these are likely ones that could benefit from further discussion in class. I recommend that, if at all possible, students find a way to mark up the articles or books as they are read to improve reading comprehension.

# Attendance Policy

Attendance statement required by Rutgers: “Students are expected to attend all classes; if you
expect to miss one or two classes, please use the University absence reporting website
https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/ to indicate the date and reason for your absence. An email is
automatically sent to me.”

OK. Now that you have read the statement required by Rutgers, here is an explanation of how attendance will be handled in this course. Attendance is required. Students are expected to join each discussion section meeting at the scheduled starting time and to stay until the end of the class. Students are
expected to have their Zoom cameras on during class. If you have a problem attending
discussion sections or keeping your Zoom camera on, you should discuss this with your
instructor.

# Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism

Plagiarism undermines the very core of the mission of this class, which is for each student to grow as an emerging scholar. Without completing all the assignments yourself, you will never be able to achieve objectives. Even worse, plagiarism reduces the trust in each other's work that is a necessary component of the scientific enterprise.

Plagiarism includes copying in whole or part from previously published academic works without proper citation, but it also covers passing off someone else's work as your own regardless of whether or not it has been published. Hiring someone to write an essay for you is just as much plagiarism as if you copied an existing article for your work. Furthermore, it should go without saying that copying another student's work in this class (with or without their permission) violates academic integrity. For full details of what plagiarism means in a given situation, refer to the university policy available from the registrar, which I will use when needing to make determination about plagiarism.
