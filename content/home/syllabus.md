# Learning Goals

1. Be able to evaluate a broad range of methods in cognitive science and consider how they suit various research questions
2. Understand basic principles of experimental design and how to move from a general idea to a specific research question
3. Consider ethical questions and the role of the Institutional Review Board
4. Find appropriate background literature suitable to particular research questions
5. Program your own experiment in Python/PsychoPy and take your research online

# Required Texts

The following books are required (They are both free)). In addition, I will be posting supplemental articles that I will post on the course website.

# Canvas Site

I have created a website for the course (https://cogscimethods.netlify.app/). Much of the material needed for the course will be available on the website via a link to an Open Science Framework repository. I will also post things to the Rutgers Canvas page for ease of access.

# Course Policies

## Assessment Components

- **50%** (Group Project). One important element of advancing scientific knowledge is the ability to reproduce the materials, procedures, and analytic plan of published research in efforts to obtain similar results in other samples (i.e., replication). To the degree that research findings can be replicated by other labs using the same methods/materials,but of course with appropriate statistical power,more confidence can be placed on the hypothesized associations between abstract theoretical constructs. The primary assignment for this course is a group project that will involve the following: 

    - Group Project Proposal (5%): Your group will need submit a short 1-page research proposal. This proposal should summarize the paper you are going to replicate. You will need to get article approval from me. 
    
    - CITI Training and Institutional Review Board (IRB) Forms (5%): Although student research projects are covered by the IRB,  the ethicical implications of your research project are important. To this end, you will become CITI certified and also fill out Rutgers IRB forms which involves creating your own consent form. We will start on this in class.
    
    - Preregistration (5%): After you have gottten you topic approved, you will pregresiter your experiment (we will dicuss what this is in class). The preregistration should be two primary parts: (1) background and (2) an analysis plan. The background does not need to be lengthy, 2 pages or less, enough information for me to give you feedback on the big idea and feasibility before you get too far along. I will not grade the preregistration for being correct or accurate; I will only grade it for being complete (i.e., if  you answer all the questions but some of your answers are wrong or don’t make sense, you will still get full credit). The preregistration is meant to be an opportunity to get feedback from me early so that you can assess feasibility and develop the idea into a strong final presentation the whole class can benefit from. 

    - Programmed Experiment (10%). 
    
    - Data Analysis (5%). 
    
    - Group presentation (10%): The last two classes will be devoted to presenting your final project to the class. Each groups will be give a 10 minute presentation followed by up to 5 minutes of questions from the audience.
Presentations are a group effort, and it is expected that all members will either present or address questions. Do make an effort to be inclusive. I strongly recommend you rehearse this and make sure timing and flow is right, and that no one person is over-dominant or unheard. Each group will have no more than 10 minutes, strictly observed with a timer (I will stop you when time is up, regardless of whether you're done or not). There will be no time for questions from the audience, but I will either comment, ask a question, or add something/ 
    
*Each step must be finished in order*

- **10%** (Small Assignments). You will complete several short assignments related to the material covered in class. The details of the assignments will be described in more detail in class. 
    
- **30%** (Reading and Presentation Reflections). We have a number of readings and guest lectures over the course of the semester. Starting Week 2, you will write a short response on the week’s readings and/or presentation, if one (500-1000 words). Reflections will be due on Friday by 4:00 P.M. These must be submitted via Canvas. The purpose of the response is to get you thinking about the readings, connecting the new material to other readings and discussion, and offering your own thoughts.

The responses will be graded according to the following rubric:

<div align="center">

- **10%** (Extension Paper). You will be expected to write a short 6 – 10 page double spaced paper that details the replication project you conducted and how you would like to extend it in some way, either by hypothesizing a short follow up to address some issue that arose during it. You can use this paper to propose an extension using a method we talked about in class.

# Late Assignments

I am pretty flexible and we are currently living through a global pandemic. Please let me know BEFORE THE DUE DATE and we can work something out. 

# Absences

Students are expected to attend all classes; if you expect to miss one or two classes, please use the University absence reporting website https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/ to indicate the date and reason for your absence.  An email is automatically sent to me.

# Attendance Policy

Attendance statement required by Rutgers: “Students are expected to attend all classes; if you
expect to miss one or two classes, please use the University absence reporting website
https://sims.rutgers.edu/ssra/ to indicate the date and reason for your absence. An email is
automatically sent to me.”

OK. Now that you have read the statement required by Rutgers, here is an explanation of how attendance will be handled in this course. Attendance is required. Students are expected to join each discussion section meeting at the scheduled starting time and to stay until the end of the class.

# Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism

Plagiarism undermines the very core of the mission of this class, which is for each student to grow as an emerging scholar. Without completing all the assignments yourself, you will never be able to achieve objectives. Even worse, plagiarism reduces the trust in each other's work that is a necessary component of the scientific enterprise.

Plagiarism includes copying in whole or part from previously published academic works without proper citation, but it also covers passing off someone else's work as your own regardless of whether or not it has been published. Hiring someone to write an essay for you is just as much plagiarism as if you copied an existing article for your work. Furthermore, it should go without saying that copying another student's work in this class (with or without their permission) violates academic integrity. For full details of what plagiarism means in a given situation, refer to the university policy available from the registrar, which I will use when needing to make determination about plagiarism.

For additional information on the Rutgers University policies on academic integrity, go to
http://academicintegrity.rutgers.edu/.

# Diversity Statement

I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, SES, etc. ) To help accomplish this:

 - If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Brown records, please let me know!

- If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). 

- I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

# Disability Services

Rutgers University is committed to the creation of an inclusive and safe learning environment for all students, and welcomes students with disabilities into all the University's educational programs. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) is responsible for the determination of appropriate accommodations for students who encounter barriers due to disability. Once a student has completed the ODS process (registration, initial appointment, and submitted documentation) and reasonable accommodations are determined to be necessary and appropriate, a Letter of Accommodation (LOA) will be provided. The LOA must be given to each course instructor by the student and followed up with a discussion. This should be done as early in the semester as possible as accommodations are not retroactive. More information can be found at www.ods.rutgers.edu. You can contact ODS at (848)445-6800 or via email at dsoffice@echo.rutgers.edu.
