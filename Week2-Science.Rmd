# How do we acquire knowldge?

---
- Intuition/Anecdote
--

  - Based on emotions 
  - 
--

- Authority

--
  - Aristotle once said, "Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible."
  - We tend to believe people who are in a position of power
--

- Rationalism

--
  - Logic and reason
  -  Deduction
--

- Empiricism

--
  - Experience and observation
    - Through our senses

# The Scientific Method

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

```
---
# Features of Science

- Systematic empiricism
  - Design controlled studies to observe behavior and draw conclusions
--

- Publicly verifiable knowledge
 - Present research so it can be observed, replicated, criticized, and tested in other ways
--

- Empirically solvable
  - Questions can be answered
  - Falsifiability
---

# Think - Pair - Share 

class: inverse center middle

- List three empirical questions about human behavior. List three nonempirical questions about human behavior

---

# Goals of Science

class: inverse center middle

1. Describe
2. Predict 
3. Determine
4. Explain

---

# Scientific Norms

- Mertonian Norms
1. Universalism
  
    - Knowledge is knowldge regardless who comes up with it
    
2. Disinterestedness
  
    - Our goal as scientists is to make advancements--not cash in
  
3. Communality
  
    - Openly share knowledge - remove the paywall
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY
  
4. Organized Skepticism
  
    - Accept nothing at face value!

# Science vs. Psuedoscience

- Claims that appear scientific on the surface but violate the criteria of science

- Look out for: 

  - Claims that are untestable and cannot be refuted
  - Claims that rely on imprecise, biased, or vague language
  - Evidence that is based on anecdotes and testimonials rather than scientific data
  - Evidence from so called "experts" 
  - Claims based only confirmatory evidence
  - Reliance on scientific evidence that cannot be independenly verified.
